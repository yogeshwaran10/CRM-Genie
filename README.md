## ✨ **What Makes CRM Genie Special?**

Imagine you could simply type something like:
> "Show me all customers who purchased in the last month."

And within moments, your database delivers exactly what you asked for—no technical mumbo-jumbo required. Here’s how CRM Genie makes it happen:

- **Chat, Don’t Code**: Transform casual prompts into precise SQL queries with the help of **CodeLlama AI**. Yes, it’s like magic, but smarter.
- **Real-Time Results**: Your query is executed instantly on the **SQLite database**, and voilà! Results appear like a genie granting wishes.
- **Simple Yet Powerful**: A clean, intuitive interface ensures anyone can navigate and explore data, even if you think SQL is a typo for "squirrel."

## 🚀 **How Does It Work?**

1. You type your question in plain English.
2. Behind the scenes, our AI (powered by **CodeLlama**) translates your words into SQL, the language databases love.
3. The query runs on our trusty **SQLite** database.
4. You get instant, clear results displayed right in the app.

It’s like having a super-smart assistant who speaks both human and database fluently.
